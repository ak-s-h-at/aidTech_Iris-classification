# Iris Flower Classification

This project is a machine learning task that focuses on iris flower classification. The goal is to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project uses the Iris Flower Dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset

The Iris Flower Dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and contains samples of three different iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset is widely used for classification tasks and serves as a good starting point for beginners.

## Project Description

This project was created as part of a machine learning internship. The code implements a classification model using machine learning techniques to accurately classify iris flowers based on their features. It demonstrates the application of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
